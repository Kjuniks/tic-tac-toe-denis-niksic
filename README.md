# Tic Tac Toe Project Documentation
# Overview
This documentation provides an overview of the Tic Tac Toe project, highlighting the technologies used and key features implemented.

# Technologies Used
React.js + Vite: The project is built using React.js for the frontend, and Vite is used as the build tool to enhance development speed.

Redux: State management is handled by Redux, allowing for a predictable state container and facilitating state updates across the application.

Axios: Axios is employed for making HTTP requests, enabling seamless communication with external APIs or services.

Styled-components: This CSS-in-JS library is used to style React components. It allows for dynamic styling based on component state and props.

Context API: React's Context API is utilized for managing local component state, while Redux manages global state.

React Router: For navigation within the application, React Router is employed. It enables the creation of a single-page application with dynamic routing.

Material UI: The project leverages Material UI for its UI components, providing a set of pre-designed, customizable React components that follow the Material Design guidelines.

# Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure, organizing components, styles, and utility functions into separate directories. Here's a brief overview:

src/components: Contains React components used throughout the application.

src/styles: Holds styled-components files for styling the components.

src/api: Dedicated folder for handling API-related logic and functions.

src/pages: Houses React components representing different pages in the application, connected via React Router.

src/redux: Redux-related files, including actions, reducers, and the store configuration.

src/contexts: Manages React contexts used for global state or sharing data across components.

# Key Features
Tic Tac Toe Game: The core functionality of the application is a Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid.

Global State Management with Redux: Redux is used for managing global state, ensuring a single source of truth for the application's data.

RESTful API Integration: Axios is used to make HTTP requests to a RESTful API for fetching or submitting data.

Styled Components Styling: Components are styled using the styled-components library, allowing for dynamic and responsive styling.

Routing with React Router: Implements navigation within the application using React Router for a smooth user experience.

Material UI Components: Utilizes Material UI components for a visually appealing and consistent user interface.
